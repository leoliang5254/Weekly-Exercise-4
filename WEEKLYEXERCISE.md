Civic technology is the application of digital tools, platforms, and information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enhance citizen-government interactions; improve public services, and promote participatory governance. Civic technology is based on the notion of technology for the public good, or the idea that tools should not simply work in pursuit of profit. Still, it should consider civic engagement and public value as goals of its efforts.

Smart cities that utilize ICT, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data analytics, and digital infrastructure to enhance efficiency and quality of life are greatly amplified by civic technology. With civic tech as part of their framework, smart cities can engage citizens more deeply and foster co-creation of policies and services. Participatory budgeting platforms, digital petitions, or problem reporting platforms provide residents with opportunities to express input on city operations in real-time, all of which contribute to a more responsive governance approach. This resident input not only boosts overall civic engagement levels, but also improves the trust and accountability citizens should expect from the quality of government.

Civic tech also creates opportunities for smart cities to monetize streams of available data provided by IoT systems. By creating dashboards and platforms for both officials and citizens, governments can use evidence-based and data-driven decision-making for infrastructure, safety, and sustainability.

Another primary area that civic technology helps drive smart city outcomes is service delivery. Platforms, such as mobile apps or websites, provide residents with access to report on situations such as potholes, broken streetlights, and garbage toting, all of which can include geo-located data.

In conclusion, civic technology plays a crucial role in smart cities, acting as a link between sophisticated digital infrastructure and authentic civic engagement. Smart cities that leverage civic technology simultaneously improve efficiency while enhancing democratic participation and public trust, which makes smart cities a more livable, engaging, and sustainable community.
